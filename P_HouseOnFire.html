            <!-- General Process -->
            For this project I had the role of team leader, which meant I had to manage a team of 4 while having a tight 3 day deadline since it was part of a gamejam. The biggest problem I ran into in this project was that I had the most experience using the game engine we used (unity). This meant I had to balance managing everyone, scoping the game, planning the features, divide the tasks as well as helping everyone with using the engine.
            I ended up being mostly successful in this, but I could have done better as I forgot to communicate my planning sometimes leading to a lack of coherent vision in the team. I also didn’t check in with people’s progress enough as the person making the movement isolated themselves and ended up giving us a product which was pretty buggy, leading to me having to fix it up last minute. This in turn made it so I lost time on polishing the game up.
            I learned a lot out of this project like the importance of keeping everyone updated and giving team members a way of easily sharing progress & applied these things while managing a team for my newest project.
