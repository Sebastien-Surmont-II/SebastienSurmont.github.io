            <!-- General Process -->
            I had an idea for a cooking game with as many physics as possible.
            <br> The hardest part was balancing the game so that the physics aspect made the game more fun, instead of being frustrating.
            <br>Additionally I had the extra challenge of me wanting to include the Rattatouille movie, 
            meaning I had to incorperate the main character. Remi the rat.

            Originally I was going to put Remi on your head, but that would be wasted space on your screen without any added fun. 
            <br> So to still incorperate the rat I instead turned him into an enemy that tries to steal your food. 
            This was huge in terms of gameplay variation.

            The game also needed an engaging way to complete it, which I did in 2 different ways: reviews & a countdown.
            Either you deliver all the orders in your order list or the timer runs out. 
            Out of the orders 3 random ones will be food critiques, so you don't wanna deliver any burnt food as to not get a bad review.
