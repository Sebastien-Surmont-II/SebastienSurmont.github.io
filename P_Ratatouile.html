      <p class="project-description">This game started out with the simple concept of making a
      <span class="interactivetext">cooking game</span>, basing myself on 
      Ratatouille. The basic cooking game was fun to work on and the Ratatouille restriction made for one of the most fun aspects of
      the game, the <span class="interactivetext">rats that steal your food.</span></p>

            <!-- General Process -->
            I started off with the simple idea of making a ratatouille cooking game, so to test it out I started off making a prototype first to test
            if I could even make it fun. It was during this process that I was able to realize the gameplay & get fun new ideas.

            I was originally just
            going to put Remi on your head, but then that would be wasted space on your screen. So to solve for this I instead turned him into an
            enemy that tries to steal your food. This was huge in terms of gameplay variation.

            The game also needed an engaging way to complete it, which I did in 2 different ways: reviews & a countdown.
            Either you deliver all the orders in your order list or the timer runs out. Out of the orders you get 3 random ones will be food critiques.
            So it could be that you only mess up 3 out of the 6 meals, but they're all reviewers so you get 0 stars or vice versa. This adds
            more depth to the mechanic as it isn't as solidified.
