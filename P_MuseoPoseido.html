      <!-- Game Description -->
      <p class="project-description">I made this game with a wonderful team of 5 where I was the 
        <span class="interactivetext">lead programmer</span>, but I took on more of a central role as the 
        <span class="interactivetext">team lead</span> as well. We worked for a Mexican
        museum called <span class="interactivetext">3 Museos</span>
        to bring this game to life in which ghosts have taken over the museum and you've
        gotta suck them all up to bring the museum back to its clean state.

              <!-- General Process -->
              For this project I had to tackle a variety of issues such as our team having a bad distribution of talent. I was the only programmer who was able
              to quickly get tools and mechanics programmed, but as nobody else took initiative I was also the one who made the major design decions & managed the team/project.

            <!-- General Process -->
            I managed to succeed in juggling these tasks by making sure I 
            <span class="interactivetext">didn't have to micromanage</span> the project, 
            to achieve this I had to let go of the minor decisions within the project & I also installed who I trusted as the best artist as 
            <span class="interactivetext">Art Lead. </span>
            That way I didn't have to worry about art at all as I could <span class="interactivetext">trust</span> the art lead's judgement.

          Thanks to my teammates' great contrubtions like the amazing sounds and music from our sound artist & cute animations from my friend on the right
          we were able to deliver a final result that our client was very happy with.
